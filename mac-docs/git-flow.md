# Install git-flow tools
I don't use this tool for personal project. gitflow-avh is a collection of Git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for Vincent Driessen's branching model. This fork adds functionality not added to the original branch. https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh

To install run the following:
- "brew install git-flow-avh"

To get auto completion and alias for oh-my-zsh do the following:
- edit ~/.zshrc
- add git-flow to the end of the plugin attribute ex. plugins=(... git-flow)
